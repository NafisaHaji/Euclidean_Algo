# Euclidean_Algo

I created an interview question and its sample python solution.

Interview question: On the Cartesian coordinate system (2-D plane), we have coordinates (x, y) that make up lines. Write python code that uses the coordinates to calculate the euclidean distance for each line and then outputs a dictionary in order of the smallest distance to the largest distance.

Note: for measuring the distance between two points ((x1, y1) and (x2,y2)), you can use the following formula: distance = sqrt((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2))

Input Format: a list of x,y coordinates forming lines. Coordinates are real numbers.

Output Format: euclidean distance for each line and a dictionary of lines in order of the line with the smallest distance to the largest distance.
